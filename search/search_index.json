Features kafka ( Sink ) A Kafka sink publishes events processed by WSO2 SP to a topic with a partition for a Kafka cluster. The events can be published in the TEXT XML JSON or Binary format. If the topic is not already created in the Kafka cluster, the Kafka sink creates the default partition for the given topic. The publishing topic and partition can be a dynamic value taken from the Siddhi event. To configure a sink to use the Kafka transport, the type parameter should have kafka as its value. kafkaMultiDC ( Sink ) A Kafka sink publishes events processed by WSO2 SP to a topic with a partition for a Kafka cluster. The events can be published in the TEXT XML JSON or Binary format. If the topic is not already created in the Kafka cluster, the Kafka sink creates the default partition for the given topic. The publishing topic and partition can be a dynamic value taken from the Siddhi event. To configure a sink to publish events via the Kafka transport, and using two Kafka brokers to publish events to the same topic, the type parameter must have kafkaMultiDC as its value. kafka ( Source ) A Kafka source receives events to be processed by WSO2 SP from a topic with a partition for a Kafka cluster. The events received can be in the TEXT XML JSON or Binary format. If the topic is not already created in the Kafka cluster, the Kafka sink creates the default partition for the given topic. kafkaMultiDC ( Source ) The Kafka Multi-Datacenter(DC) source receives records from the same topic in brokers deployed in two different kafka clusters. It filters out all the duplicate messages and ensuresthat the events are received in the correct order using sequential numbering. It receives events in formats such as TEXT , XML JSON and Binary`.The Kafka Source creates the default partition '0' for a given topic, if the topic has not yet been created in the Kafka cluster. Dependencies Following JARs are needed from <KAFKA_HOME>/libs directory. kafka_2.11-*.jar kafka-clients-*.jar metrics-core-*.jar scala-library-2.11.*.jar scala-parser-combinators_2.11.*.jar (if exists) zkclient-*.jar zookeeper-*.jar Installation For installing this extension and to add the dependent jars on various siddhi execution environments refer Siddhi documentation section on adding extensions and jars .

QUERY PARAMETERS Name Description Default Value Possible Data Types Optional Dynamic bootstrap.servers This parameter specifies the list of Kafka servers to which the Kafka sink must publish events. This list should be provided as a set of comma -separated values. There must be at least two servers in this list. e.g., localhost:9092,localhost:9093 .

This ID allows receivers to identify the sink that published a specific message. null STRING Yes No key The key contains the values that are used to maintain ordering in a Kafka partition. null STRING Yes No partition.no The partition number for the given topic. Only one partition ID can be defined.

This list can be provided as a set of comma-separated values. e.g., localhost:9092,localhost:9093 STRING No No topic.list This specifies the list of topics to which the source must listen. This list can be provided as a set of comma-separated values. e.g., topic_one,topic_two STRING No No group.id This is an ID to identify the Kafka source group. The group ID ensures that sources with the same topic and partition that are in the same group do not receive the same event.

Possible values are as follows: single.thread : To run the Kafka source on a single thread. topic.wise : To use a separate thread per topic. partition.wise : To use a separate thread per partition.

This is provided as a list of comma-separated values. e.g., 0,1,2, . 0 STRING Yes No seq.enabled If this parameter is set to true , the sequence of the events received via the source is taken into account.

The value for this parameter is specified in the following format: <topic>=<offset>,<topic>=<offset>, When an offset is defined for a topic, the Kafka source skips reading the message with the number specified as the offset as well as all the messages sent previous to that message. If the offset is not defined for a specific topic it reads messages from the beginning. e.g., stocks=100,trades=50 reads from the 101th message of the stocks topic, and from the 51st message of the trades topic. null STRING Yes No enable.auto.commit This parameter specifies whether to commit offsets automatically. By default, as the Siddhi Kafka source reads messages from Kafka, it will periodically(Default value is set to 1000ms. You can configure it with auto.commit.interval.ms property as an optional.configuration ) commit its current offset (defined as the offset of the next message to be read) for the partitions it is reading from back to Kafka. To guarantee at-least-once processing, we recommend you to enable Siddhi Periodic State Persistence when enable.auto.commit property is set to true . When you would like more control over exactly when offsets are committed, you can set enable.auto.commit to false and Siddhi will commit the offset once the records are successfully processed at the Source.

This is provided as a list of comma-separated values. e.g., 0,1,2, . 0 STRING Yes No seq.enabled If this parameter is set to true , the sequence of the events received via the source is taken into account. Therefore, each event should contain a sequence number as an attribute value to indicate the sequence. false BOOL Yes No is.binary.message In order to receive binary events via the Kafka source,it is required to setthis parameter to 'True'. false BOOL Yes No topic.offsets.map This parameter specifies reading offsets for each topic and partition. The value for this parameter is specified in the following format: <topic>=<offset>,<topic>=<offset>, When an offset is defined for a topic, the Kafka source skips reading the message with the number specified as the offset as well as all the messages sent previous to that message. If the offset is not defined for a specific topic it reads messages from the beginning. e.g., stocks=100,trades=50 reads from the 101th message of the stocks topic, and from the 51st message of the trades topic. null STRING Yes No enable.offsets.commit This parameter specifies whether to commit offsets. If the manual asynchronous offset committing is needed, enable.offsets.commit should be true and enable.auto.commit should be false . If periodical committing is needed enable.offsets.commit should be true and enable.auto.commit should be true . If committing is not needed, enable.offsets.commit should be false . Note: enable.auto.commit is an optional.configuration property. If it is set to true , Source will periodically(default: 1000ms. Configurable with auto.commit.interval.ms property as an optional.configuration ) commit its current offset (defined as the offset of the next message to be read) for the partitions it is reading from back to Kafka. To guarantee at-least-once processing, we recommend you to enable Siddhi Periodic State Persistence when enable.auto.commit property is set to true . During manual committing, it might introduce a latency during consumption. true BOOL Yes No optional.configuration This parameter contains all the other possible configurations that the consumer is created with. e.g., ssl.keystore.type:JKS,batch.size:200 . null STRING Yes No Examples EXAMPLE 1 @App:name('TestExecutionPlan') define stream BarStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); @info(name = 'query1') @source( type='kafka', topic.list='kafka_topic,kafka_topic2', group.id='test', threading.option='partition.wise', bootstrap.servers='localhost:9092', partition.no.list='0,1', @map(type='xml')) Define stream FooStream (symbol string, price float, volume long); from FooStream select symbol, price, volume insert into BarStream; This kafka source configuration listens to the kafka_topic and kafka_topic2 topics with 0 and 1 partitions. A thread is created for each topic and partition combination. The events are received in the XML format, mapped to a Siddhi event, and sent to a stream named FooStream .
